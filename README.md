# EZGas
Final project for the Software Engineering exam at Politecnico di Torino about **EZGas**, a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and to locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice. EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC).
