Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

- Possibility to work with an "industry standard" using Spring and Git environments.
- Direct connection between theory and practice application, both by labs and project
- Capability of managing a real-world project with different teammates

# Worst things
- Bad organization and communication (due also to covid situation): sometimes there weren't quick answers or general ones, often there were different answers for the same questions, hence we didn't know exactly what to do
- Lack of introductory explanation of some tools, like Spring
- Maybe the team selection choice was a good one, but this affected some groups in which one or more members after a certain point decided not to proceed anymore, therefore timing became a little bit problematic

# Suggestions 
- Maybe a slightly simpler project could be easier both to manage and to complete by us, as not to lose focus on the important (software engineering) part with respect to the coding one
- Maybe it was better to focus more in the Agile software process, since it's the most used nowadays
- Having different channels (slack, git issues, virtual classrooms) has brought a little bit of "chaos", since we couldn't always find the right answer in the right place and we had to search through all of them to find it.
